# Introduction

Distributed Testing is the dark side of Distributed Computing.

Nowadays, the computing tools available are such that any competent developer can build a distributed application â€”which is good, because most modern applications are, to a greater
or lesser extent, distributed. Every phone application that talks to a remote HTTP server,
every web site that references a remote resource, even every build process which
pulls in a remote artifact: distributed.
